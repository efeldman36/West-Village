In 2019, there were 768 Airbnb rentals listed in Manhattan’s West Village. Listings were located between latitudes of 40.728610 and 40.740690, and longitudes of -74.010870 and -73.997150. On average, hosts in this neighborhood had 6.5 listings. Listings were available on average about 85.5 days out of the year (availability ranged from 0 to 365 days). It is strange that over one-fourth of the West Village listings on Airbnb were not available at all during the year––it is possible that availability data wasn’t reported by every listing.  

The average minimum nights required to reserve the apartment was about 7.8, but the minimum number of nights ranged from one to 365. The bulk of the minimum nights required ranged from 1 to 31 nights, but there were a few rentals that required 45, 60, 90, 100, 120, and 365 nights to book a stay.

There is no clear trend between minimum number of nights required to book a listing and price of Airbnb listings across Manhattan. Most of the data stayed close to the origin (low price and few number of nights required), but there were a few outliers where a high minimum number of nights (three outliers with 1000+ nights) is associated with a low price per night or a small minimum number of nights is associated with an astronomical price (three outliers with $10,000 per night).
